# @kernel/sdk (vendored)

GENERATED — do not edit. This is a self-contained compiled snapshot of the
kernel SDK (`packages/sdk` + its contracts runtime) produced by the core
repo's `scripts/vendor-sdk.mjs`. Regenerate from core to update:

```sh
# from the core repo root
node scripts/vendor-sdk.mjs <path-to-this-directory>
```

- Contract hash: `94b88e296d4d9d6d844e9b53c5300df5435f715eac7aadc8d860948935b21641`
- Core commit: `d03f5bcc607e741f89b19db954a2ebc2c33cc529`

The contract hash is exported at runtime as `KERNEL_CONTRACT_HASH`; drift CI
compares it against core@main (stage-20 §2). Distribution via git-tag installs
(DP 10) replaces this vendoring at the Stage 20 release step — the consuming
import surface (`@kernel/sdk`) stays identical.
